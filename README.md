## Getting Started

> Required Dependencies

To use this app, you need to download the packages ejs, express, body-parser, & nodemon

> How to Install

To install these packages, simply go into a new or already existing terminal in Visual Studio Code and type out **npm i ejs express body-parser nodemon**

> Executing the Program

When executing this program, go to the terminal and make sure you're in the right folder. If you aren't you can simply use the **cd** keyword followed by the folder you want to go to. Afterwards, make sure to initialize the file *app.js* by typing in the terminal **node app**. This will ensure the site works properly.

To actually get to the site, simply open a local host server and use the port **3000**.
This should look like **127.0.0.1:3000** in the url space.
